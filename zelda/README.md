# Project 5: Zelda
Implementation of additional features for the course's Legend of Zelda game. 

## Specfication

* Implement hearts that sometimes drop from vanquished enemies at random, which will heal the player for a full heart when picked up.
* Add pots to the game world at random that the player can pick up, at which point their animation will change to reflect them carrying the pot.
* When carrying a pot, the player should be able to throw the pot. When thrown, the pot will travel in a straight line based on where the player is looking. When it collides with a wall, or collides with an enemy, it should disappear. When it collides with an enemy, it should do 1 point of damage to that enemy as well.
