# Project 3: Match 3 
Implementation of additional features for the course's Match 3 game. 

## Specfication


* *Implement time addition on matches, such that scoring a match extends the timer by 1 second per tile in a match.* 
* *Ensure Level 1 starts just with simple flat blocks, with later levels generating the blocks with patterns on them. These should be worth more points.*
* *Create random shiny versions of blocks that will destroy an entire row on match, granting points for each block in the row.* Shiny blocks, note, should not be their own unique entity, but should be “special” versions of the colors already in the game that override the basic rules of what happens when you match three of that color.
* *Only allow swapping when it results in a match. If there are no matches available to perform, reset the board.*
